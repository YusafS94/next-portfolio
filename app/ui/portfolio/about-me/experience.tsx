        Having studied at the University of Huddersfield in a 4 year sandwich
        degree in Web Programming, I have gained a wealth of knowledge and
        experience in the field of web development. My studies have provided me
        with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies,
        allowing me to create dynamic and responsive web applications.
        Additionally, my sandwich year has given me the opportunity to apply my
        skills in a real-world setting, further enhancing my understanding of
        the industry and its best practices.
